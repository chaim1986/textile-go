This repository contains Textile's API and daemon used to create a cross platform cli and mobile frameworks. The ```textile-go``` library is primarily used in the [Textile Photos](https://www.textile.photos) mobile application. 

Until [Textile Photos](https://www.textile.photos) is ready for public release, this library will be rapidly evolving.
